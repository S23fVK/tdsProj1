# Seattle GitHub User and Repository Analysis
This program retrieves data about Seattle Github users (with more than 200 followers) using Github API and makes csv files of their repo details, making it easier to analyse trends in the data.

# Recommendations:
- Learning JavaScript or Python is recommended as that is the most commonly used programming language in Seattle.
- Having a Readme file which explains the contents of the repo will be very beneficial to viewers.
 
# Note: 
Github API token has been replaced with \<inserted github token here> due to security concerns.
